# internetRetail
This project was motivated by the want to be able to get products by their id, or category. To make new products, give them tag id's, and give them a category. TO be able to add, update, or delete items.
## Install
The user must first install packages using the npm commands. node, which gives us json. These both need to be installed before anything will run. Once these are done make sure you have mysql on your computer. This will assist in getting the database up and going.
## Use
Once the user is ready they need to install their node and sequel. After they have made sure these have been installed, the user then needs to open mysql to get the database up. Once this happens they can run the seeds, and get everyting loaded. Then the user needs to run the server to make sure the port is listening. After things are up and listening the user can use insomnia to do the requests. They can add a tag, a product, and a category. The user can update a tag, a product, and a category. Finally the user can delete all as well.
